  <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
  <div class="problem">
    <p>
      In today’s digital age, college students often struggle to manage multiple academic deadlines, 
      extracurricular commitments, and personal goals efficiently. Many rely on paper planners or 
      scattered apps that lack integration and real-time reminders. This often leads to missed deadlines, 
      reduced productivity, and increased stress levels.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal of this project is to design a centralized and intuitive web-based task management tool 
      specifically for students. The platform will allow users to track assignments, set automated 
      reminders, and visualize workload distribution using color-coded calendars and progress indicators. 
      By addressing this issue, students can better manage time, maintain balance, and improve academic 
      performance.
